## Monthly Budgeting app - UniSave

This application, named **UniSave**, will serve as a personal budgeting app *for 
university students*. I am interested in this topic since I am 
a university student who struggles with budgeting and saving 
my money. I think a lot of university students like myself 
could benefit from an app that would help plan out daily, 
weekly, and monthly spending. 

*List of features*:
- Pie chart showing what categories your money is being spent on
- How much money is left to spend in each category
- Tips on how to increase savings
