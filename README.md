# My Personal Project

## Monthly Budgeting app - UniSave

This application, named **UniSave**, will serve as a personal budgeting app *for 
university students*. I am interested in this topic since I am 
a university student who struggles with budgeting and saving 
my money. I think a lot of university students like myself 
could benefit from an app that would help plan out daily, 
weekly, and monthly spending. 

*List of features*:
- Pie chart showing what categories your money is being spent on
- How much money is left to spend in each category
- Tips on how to increase savings 

## User Stories 

*Phase 1*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add recent purchases to their designated spending category/categories
- As a user, I want to be able to see how much of my total budget I have spent  
- As a user, I want to be able to see the list of purchases I made in a category after adding a purchase 
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to set up a user profile with my name and my budget 

*Phase 2*:
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to save my purchases added to categories to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my purchases added to categories from file 

## Instructions for Grader
- Open the application by running the CategoriesWindow class
- When opening the application first click the user button and add a name and income and then press enter
- You can generate the first required event by typing the name of a purchase in the first text field, a cost in the second text field, and selecting a category from the combo box, then clicking on the second text field and pressing the enter key on your keyboard. This adds a purchase to the selected category.
- You can generate the second required event by clicking the calculate button. This shows the total amount spent on purchases. 
- You can locate my visual component on the bottom right of the CategoriesWindow
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save button on the CategoriesWindow
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load button on the CategoriesWindow and then the calculate button.
